# Project Title

This project demonstartes building a Spring Boot based API for a simple search functionality. The search is powered by AWS ElasticSearch. We the deploy the API on ElasticBeanstalk. Finally, we would place the API behind AWS API Gatewatay.

A call to API is thus fronted by gateway which is protected by AWS IAM user. All the calls to API will need proper autrozations to be processed.
